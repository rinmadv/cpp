## *Vector or multiset*

**Duplicate management** : While multiset would enable better sorting, making shortest span easier to computer, multiset doesn't support duplicates (and the subject does not specify anything about it).

**Insertion performance** : As multiset needs to store elements in a sorted order, insertion is more costly in terms of performance.

## *max_elements and min_elements*

**max_elements** : returns the largest element in a range
**min_elements** : returns the smallest element in a range
