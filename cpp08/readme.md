## *Vector or multiset*

**Duplicate management** : While multiset would enable better sorting, making shortest span easier to computer, multiset doesn't support duplicates (and the subject does not specify anything about it).

**Insertion performance** : As multiset needs to store elements in a sorted order, insertion is more costly in terms of performance.

## *Size() and capacity()*

**method size()** : returns the number of elements currently stored in a containor

**method capacity()** : returns the number of elements that could be stored in the containor (allocated spadce)
